## PancakeSwap's SEO Strategy Analysis

PancakeSwap ranks well for these keywords because they:
1. Use exact brand match terms in titles and descriptions
2. Target "binance smart chain", "bep20", "defi" as high-value keywords
3. Have descriptive social media sharing tags
4. Use structured data for rich snippets
5. Focus on user intent: swap, earn, trade, farm

Your implementation now mirrors this strategy with appropriate variations for your clone project.

## Important Notes

1. **Branding**: Be careful with trademark usage. The current implementation positions you as a "clone" which is legal, but consider rebranding for your own identity.

2. **Content Freshness**: Update content regularly. PancakeSwap updates their content frequently to rank higher.

3. **Backlinks**: Quality backlinks matter more than quantity. Focus on reputable crypto and DeFi websites.

4. **User Experience**: Google ranks sites with good UX higher. Ensure fast loading, mobile-responsive design, and intuitive navigation.
